🟢 1️⃣ ESP32 ↔ RFID RC522 CONNECTIONS :

| RC522 Pin | ESP32 Pin | Purpose          |
| --------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| SDA       | GPIO 5    | SS (Chip Select) |
| SCK       | GPIO 18   | SPI Clock        |
| MOSI      | GPIO 23   | SPI MOSI         |
| MISO      | GPIO 19   | SPI MISO         |
| RST       | GPIO 22   | Reset            |
| 3.3V      | 3.3V      | Power            |
| GND       | GND       | Ground           |

🟢 2️⃣ ESP32 ↔ LCD I2C (16x2, Address 0x27) :

| LCD Pin | ESP32 Pin | Purpose   |
| ------- | --------- | --------- |
| VCC     | 5V (VIN)  | Power     |
| GND     | GND       | Ground    |
| SDA     | GPIO 21   | I2C Data  |
| SCL     | GPIO 22   | I2C Clock |

🟢 3️⃣ ESP32 ↔ BUZZER CONNECTION : 

| Buzzer Pin | ESP32 Pin | Purpose |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- |
| + (VCC)    | GPIO 27   | Control |
| - (GND)    | GND       | Ground  |

🟢 4️⃣ POWER CONNECTION SUMMARY : 

| Device | Power Pin | ESP32 Pin |
| ------ | --------- | --------- |
| RFID   | VCC       | 3.3V      |
| LCD    | VCC       | 5V (VIN)  |
| Buzzer | +         | GPIO 27   |
| All    | GND       | GND       |


🟢 5️⃣ VERY IMPORTANT FINAL CHECK
Before submission, verify:

RFID powered from 3.3V only

LCD shows text when powered

Buzzer beeps on scan

All GND connected together

## 🔧 Working Principle

1. Student scans RFID card on RC522 module.  
2. ESP32 reads the UID of the card.  
3. ESP32 sends the UID to the Python Flask server over WiFi.  
4. Flask server maps UID to student details (SNO, Name, Department).  
5. Current Date and Time are automatically generated.  
6. Attendance is stored in `attendance.xlsx`.  
7. LCD shows "Attendance Marked" and buzzer beeps for confirmation.

## 🧪 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Required Python Libraries

bash
```
pip install flask openpyxl
```
You Should be the safe the file in the order or a folder.
```
cd C:\Users
```
You should see:
```
Running on http://<PC_IP>:5000
```

3️⃣ Upload ESP32 Code
Open attendance_in_esp32.ino in Arduino IDE

Select Board: ESP32 Dev Module

Select correct COM Port

Update this line with your PC IP: 
```
const char* serverIP = "YOUR_PC_IP";
```
Upload the code
